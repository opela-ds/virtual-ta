You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\n\n\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\n\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\n\n\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel\u2019s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n\n\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return\n\n\n\nNotice there is no \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n code block.\n\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n is used to execute some code \nonly\n if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.\n\n\nTry rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default \nhandler\n class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.\n\n\nAnother possible problem:\n\nBy default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues \nTDS > Development Tools > unicode\n\n\nSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.\n\n\nLet us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "181": {"post_id": 582864, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/53", "original_text": "image\n697\u00d7136 8.17 KB\n\n\neven though its their\n\n\ni don\u2019t know why i am facing this issue anyone please check my git\n\n\n\n\nGitHub - NAMAN-BERI/actions"}, "182": {"post_id": 582892, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/54", "original_text": "how to create a iitm account in github\u2026i am not getting the username\n\nplease guide\n\nits proceeding like this \u2026for my user name\n\n\nimage\n594\u00d7296 15.8 KB"}, "183": {"post_id": 582893, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/55", "original_text": "Doubt :\n\nShould the 3rd question (github) done in the iitm github mail or any of the personal mail ?"}, "184": {"post_id": 582897, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/56", "original_text": "Im not able to get the ngrok question correct.

You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\n\n\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a \u201cscientist\u201d, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the \u201cspirit of your question\u201d.\n\n\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\n\n\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\n\n\nIn the meanwhile:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "219": {"post_id": 586539, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/91", "original_text": "thank you. you have no idea how much this helps sir"}, "220": {"post_id": 586774, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/92", "original_text": "Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong.

Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\n\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\n\n\nThis renders \nname == main\n part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\n\n\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You \ndo not\n create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\n\n\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\n\n\nThanks for your input.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "257": {"post_id": 588529, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/132", "original_text": "@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n  sir pls help me to fix this issue"}, "258": {"post_id": 588700, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/133", "original_text": "Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side.

Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.\n\n\nI just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.\n\n\nIn other words getting 10/10 in \nevaluate.py\n does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.\n\n\nSo do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of \nevaluate.py\n. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general \nidea\n of the task.\n\n\nThat said, \nevaluate.py\n is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\n\n\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\n\n\nA word of caution:\n \n(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)\n Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (\npossibly your first task\n) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "573": {"post_id": 593744, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/105", "original_text": "Respected \n@s.anand\n \n@carlton\n and \n@Jivraj\n ,\n\n\nIs anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page?

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ \n(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)\n for us!\n\n\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\n\n\nIn short we are working on it.

This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation\n \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Best for \nreproducibility\n and \ncollaboration\n since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\n\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndon\u2019t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n\n\u2022 If you \ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n\n\u2022 Using \ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\n\n\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\n\nUse a \nrequirements.txt\n file for reproducibility.\n\n\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards"}, "1146": {"post_id": 588155, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/3", "original_text": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\n\n\n\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing to your second question,\n\n\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24f2006531:\n\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\n\n\n\nNever try to list requirements.txt.

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "1542": {"post_id": 590883, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/reattempt-graded-assignment-after-deadline/166349/1", "original_text": "I missed a week\u2019s worth of learning, and I\u2019d like to catch up by attempting the assignments after going through the video tutorials.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations.

All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you."}, "1750": {"post_id": 594914, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866/21", "original_text": "sir\u2026please extend the deadline\u2026"}, "1751": {"post_id": 594918, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866/22", "original_text": "@carlton\n \n@s.anand\n Yes Sir, Please extend the deadline"}, "1752": {"post_id": 594920, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866/23", "original_text": "Hi Instructor team,\n\n\nThank you for your response.

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.\n\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.\n\nWould it be possible to implement this change?"}, "1757": {"post_id": 594226, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/regarding-github-mail-for-project/166891/1", "original_text": "Is it important to use an IITM mail ID in GitHub for the project?\n\n\n@carlton"}, "1758": {"post_id": 594777, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/regarding-github-mail-for-project/166891/2", "original_text": "Currently we do not have any explicit policy regarding requiring IITM email as the github profile name or the github repo owner.\n\n\nWe DO however require you to use your IITM email when submitting the project submission form.\n\n\nWe are clarifying with operations at the moment if this arrangement satisfies their requirements.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n\n\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\n\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n\n\nRun evalute.py using uv.\n\n\n\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "1761": {"post_id": 594941, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/regarding-project1-for-file-not-detecting-after-sending-post-request/167172/1", "original_text": "sir i am getting an error in this function calling which you have demonstrate yesterday , i am attaching my code also the error with it.

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""}, "1818": {"post_id": 598346, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/2", "original_text": "i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this\n\n\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online\n, it worked"}, "1819": {"post_id": 598470, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/roe-instructions-request/168142/1", "original_text": "Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon.

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n\n\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\n\n\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n\n\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n\n\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n\n\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\n\n\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions\n\n\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n\n\nHow limited the time is.\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\n\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\n\nToday\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\n\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\n\nKind regards"}, "1859": {"post_id": 599857, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/17", "original_text": "Thank you! will check out the session today"}, "1860": {"post_id": 600114, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/19", "original_text": "Hello \n@carlton\n sir , for me given constituency was \n\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"\n\nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency\n\ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\n\n\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\n\n\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957\n\n\nusing above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_gobindpur.csv\n\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen i used margin formula as\n\n\nmargin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\n\n\n\nusing this i got answer for 1st question as\n\n\nYEAR                              1992\nAC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\nWINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH\nWINNER_PARTY                       CPI\nWINNER_VOTES                    5000.0\nRUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH\nRUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC\nRUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0\nMARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114\n\n\n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\n\npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks"}, "1861": {"post_id": 600276, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/20", "original_text": "shubhamatkal:\n\n\n\n\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n shubhamatkal:\n\n\n\n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.\n\nKind regards."}, "1862": {"post_id": 600302, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/21", "original_text": "@Jivraj\n \n@carlton\n\n\u201cSATHUPALLE\u201d and \u201cNILANGA\u201d were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me.

The \nlive sessions and guidance\n have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n\nKey Challenges Faced\n\n\n \nLack of Prerequisites\n\n\nThis course did not list any \nprerequisites\n, leading many students\u2014including those from \nnon-technical backgrounds\n\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the \ncourse content, assignments, and projects\n have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n\n \nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\n\nThe \ndifficulty of the projects\n has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to \nrely heavily on peer support\n just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n\n \nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\n\nMany students joined \nTDS\n based on past \nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for \nworking professionals\n and students without prior experience.\n\n\n \nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending \n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\n to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves \nstruggling to meet expectations\n for the \nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\n\nThank you for your time and understanding.

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n\n\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\n\n\n\n\nMany students pursuing this course are \ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n\n\nThe \nlast-minute guidance\n for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n\n\nThe \nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\n feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\n\n\n\nRequest for Improvement\n\n\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\n\n\n\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\n\n\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\n\n\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\n\n\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the \ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\n\n\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this \nDiscourse thread\n where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the \nfirst page of the TDS course\n GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\n\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\n\n\n\n\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nNow it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nLLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. \n#\n \n#\n\n\nThe ROE is hard. \n#\n\n\n\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\n to check if you\u2019re ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\n\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\n\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what you\u2019ve learnt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."}, "1939": {"post_id": 599819, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/10", "original_text": "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I\u2019m speaking for a lot of my peers that we\u2019re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\n\n\nI\u2019m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\n\n\nWhile grades don\u2019t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks.

I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\n\n\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term\u2019s project was tougher than the last.\n\n\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered.

It is written in the \nTools in Data Science\n that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don\u2019t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n\n\n\n\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI \ngh\n  which we have to install in the vercel instance using \napt\n package manager.\n\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\n\n\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\n\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install \nngrok\n package.\n\n\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires \ndocker\n package installed.\n\n\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\n\n\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\n\n\nAnd many more\n\n\n\n\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\n\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\n\n\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\n\n\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\n\n\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n\n\n\n\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\n\n\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\n\n\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can\u2019t be installed locally.\n\n\n\n\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\n\n\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n\n\n\n\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\n\n\nSome ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used \u201cSave as\u201d to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\n\n\n\n\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from \nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev\n will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\n\n\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir."}, "2151": {"post_id": 603819, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29", "original_text": "Can you provide with an evaluation file like we had for Project 1."}, "2152": {"post_id": 603850, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/30", "original_text": "Can we have groups for this please? \n@Jivraj\n \n@carlton\n \n@s.anand"}, "2153": {"post_id": 603863, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/31", "original_text": "If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters."}, "2154": {"post_id": 603865, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/32", "original_text": "Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that\u2019s sufficient validation."}, "2155": {"post_id": 603870, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/33", "original_text": "If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,\n\nYes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project.

For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\n\n\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I\u2019m curious about your preference.\n\n\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\n\n\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that\u2019s where you\u2019ll spend most of your time, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you\u2019ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\n\n\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\n\n\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\n\n\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\n\n\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\n\n\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\n\n\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\n\n\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\n\n\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\n\n\n\n\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\n\n\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer\u2019s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\n\n\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type \ncode -s\n, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\n\n\nWhat is the output of \ncode -s\n? The output of \ncode -s\n cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user\u2019s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\n\n\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\n\n\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page\u2019s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10\u201320 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process\u2014from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live\u2014takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly\u2014before the GitHub Pages site is actually live\u2014resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a \n502 Bad Gateway\n error, likely due to Azure\u2019s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform\u2019s allowed response duration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a \n502 Bad Gateway\n error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure\u2019s execution time limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\n\n\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\n\n\nimage\n1854\u00d7493 55.9 KB"}, "2248": {"post_id": 611884, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/127", "original_text": "@s.anand\n\n\n@carlton\n\n\n@Jivraj\n \n@Saransh_Saini\n\n\nFinal Thoughts on Project 2\n\n\nProject 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n\n\n\n\nOrganization & Structure:\n\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\n\n\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\n\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\n\n\nTime Constraints:\n\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\n\n\nSessions & Support:\n\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\n\n\nDeployment Variability:\n\nEach GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\n\n\nEffort Acknowledgment:\n\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it\u2019s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\n\n\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\n\nEven for someone with a technical background, it\u2019s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn\u2019t always feasible before the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete \nall 57 questions\n successfully\u2014I\u2019d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\n\n\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know\u2014I\u2019m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\n\n\nThank you for the learning opportunity"}, "2249": {"post_id": 611888, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/128", "original_text": "I have implemented till GA 4 q8 with few questions here and there like one with the llamafile, etc. If someone have the functions of GA 5 ready please ping me for collaboration."}, "2250": {"post_id": 611894, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/129", "original_text": "@carlton\n How to do the GitHub Actions questions as it is a cron job based but need manual trigger for the eval script to verify.

In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.\n\nHow should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn\u2019t help.\n\n\n@s.anand\n\n\n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n\nAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.\n\nIt would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.\n\n\nI believe it would strike a good balance\u2014team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent.

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using \nvicky_server.py\n, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. \nMy mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\n\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as \u201cquestion.pdf.\u201d How can I effectively manage this problem?\n\n\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching.

Specifically:\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.\n\n\nUse \ngpt-4o-mini\n as the model.\n\n\nThe first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text.

Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.\n\n\nNote\n: This uses a dummy \nhttpx\n library, not the real one.

Is it joking? Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don\u2019t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn\u2019t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don\u2019t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber\u2019s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything.\n\n\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don\u2019t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI\u2019s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.\n\n\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\n\n\nThankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019."}, "2422": {"post_id": 614505, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/311", "original_text": "hi,\n\n\nI dont share your views.\n\n\ni feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.\n\n\nI have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.\n\n\nall the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.\n\n\nI agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.\n\n\nbut at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.\n\n\nRegarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc\u2026 At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify\n\n\nfor GA\u2019s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections\n\n\nAll in all I am happy with the course."}, "2423": {"post_id": 614516, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/313", "original_text": "Totally Agree with \n@23f2004837\n\nBest course so far from learning POV."}, "2424": {"post_id": 614540, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/314", "original_text": "Dear Shahzada,\n\n\nYou joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse.

I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nOur teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have made \nseveral hours of videos\n on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nI already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nThey explained what should be your approach? How to make project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes these were explained if you\n\n\n\n\neither took part in any live session or\n\n\nwatched the recorded video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\n\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\n\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\n\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\n\n\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nEven they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this is your first post, you\u2019ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\n\n\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\n\n\n\n\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\n\n\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\n\n\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\n\n\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nThey don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\n\n\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs\u2026 with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nAre we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\n\n\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\n\n\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\n\n\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nThey only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. \nHaving said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.\n  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\n\n\nNow is a good time to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nI want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\n\n\nLuckily for you,\n our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nIn project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\n\n\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\n\n\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\n\n\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\n\n\n\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\n\n\nThankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither \nrespect\n nor \nkindness\n is evident in your post.\n\n\nBut thank you for your feedback.\n\n\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\n\n\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS team"}, "2425": {"post_id": 614585, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/315", "original_text": "Hi, I have a few things to say\n\n\nMy background :\n\n\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\n\n\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\n\n\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\n\n\n\n\nThe video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn\u2019t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\n\n\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\n\n\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n\n\n\n\nWhy did I fail?\n\n\nLast Term\n\n\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn\u2019t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\n\n\nThis term.\n\n\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn\u2019t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn\u2019t submit both the projects.\n\n\nIn both the terms I didn\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\n\n\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\n\n\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn another topic\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this RoE evaluate?\n Implicit learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\n\n\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\n\n\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\n\n\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing \nSKLearn\n. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\n\n\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an \nimplicit\n way.\n\n\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\n\n\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\n\n\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\n\n\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\n\n\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn\u2019t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn\u2019t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\n\n\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\n\n\nThanks to \n@s.anand\n , \n@carlton\n , \n@Jivraj\n  and \n@Saransh_Saini\n\n\n\n\nJust two suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\n\n\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us."}, "2426": {"post_id": 614622, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/316", "original_text": "true but I wish they can inform how quickly they can evaluate for those using paid platforms / ngrok"}, "2427": {"post_id": 614627, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/317", "original_text": "@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n \n@Saransh_Saini\n\nHello Carlton,\n\n\nWhen are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?\n\nI have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit.

But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. \n\n\nThen I thought\u2014what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a \nstatic JSON structure\n? That quickly broke when users passed \ndifferent parameters, different files\n, or queried in \nnon-standard formats\n like \u201ccode -s\u201d or \u201ccode -v\u201d.\n\n\nThe next idea: write \nindividual Python scripts per question\n from our Graded Assignments (GA1\u2013GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. \n\n\n\n\n The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\n\n\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n\n\n Centralized engine in \nvicky_server.py\n\n\n Uses \nregex-based pattern matching\n to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\n\n\n Each solution is a structured Python function like \nga1_first_solution(query=None)\n\n\n Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\n\n\n Acts like a \nmini compiler for data science tools\n\n\n\n\n Presenting Vicky \u2013 The Mini Chatbot for TDS \n\n\nVicky is a \nsmart, modular chatbot\n built specifically for \nTool for Data Science at IIT Madras\n. It\u2019s packed with real functionality\u2014not just templates.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n \nGraded Assignment Solver\n\nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\n\n\n\n\ncode -s\n / \ncode -v\n \u2192 VS terminal commands\n\n\nCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\n\n\nGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\n\n\nData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\n\n\n\n\n \nFile Upload with Query Matching\n\nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.\n\n\n \nHTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder\n\n\n\n\nView any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy\n\n\nUpload Base64 string \u2192 Get original image back\n\n\n\n\n \nWebhooks Integration\n\n\n\n\nLive notifications via \nDiscord\n & \nSlack\n whenever \n/api\n endpoints are accessed\n\n\nMonitors \nserver status (online/offline)\n and sends real-time updates\n\n\n\n\n \nLLM Download + Auto Tunneling\n\n\n\n\nDownloads LLaMA models\n\n\nDynamically finds available ports\n\n\nCreates and exposes tunneled endpoints\n\n\n\n\n \nLive Web UI at \napp.algsoch.tech\n\n\n\n\nAsk any TDS question\n\n\nUpload and query with files\n\n\nImage decoder\n\n\nGraded assignment slider navigation\n\n\nHTML viewer\n\n\nAPI health status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Built With:\n\n\n\n\nFastAPI\n for blazing fast APIs\n\n\nRegex & Pattern Matching\n for dynamic input detection\n\n\nGitHub Copilot\n + my Python debugging and architectural thinking\n\n\nFull webhook and status monitoring system\n\n\nModular backend (\nvicky_server.py\n) and web frontend (\nvicky_app.py\n)\n\n\n\n\nI want to extend a huge thank you to \n@s.anand\n for their guidance on this project.

I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok\u2019s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.\n\n\nNew project 2 url:- \nhttps://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/"}, "2565": {"post_id": 617354, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/457", "original_text": "@carlton\n ,\n@Saransh_Saini\n\nsame goes for me sir my pc also shut down\n\nsir my  roll number is 23f2005141\n\nproject 2 url \nhttps://b2a4-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/"}, "2566": {"post_id": 617375, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/458", "original_text": "my project is running and working in vscode but when checked in git its not like\n\npost\u2014401 unauthorized\n\ni tried making changes today but same issue\u2026\n\ni think its the token but i tried pasting my token in postman\u2026none worked\n\ni used api token, proxy token and even github barrier token\u2026that didnt work either\n\ncan anyon explain why\n\n\nwhen i ran it local yep its giving me answers"}, "2567": {"post_id": 617506, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/459", "original_text": "@carlton\n \n@Saransh_Saini\n  Respected sir, by mistake I have submitted the endpoint as : \nhttps://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/\n while the corrected api which is deployed on vercel for direct requests is : \nhttps://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/\n\nThe link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint.\n\nkindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link :  \nhttps://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/\n\n\nReg.

This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.\n\n\nAt that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct.

However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\n3.

It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard?

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\n\n\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\n\n\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it\u2019s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2\u00bd weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn\u2019t receive a reply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also didn\u2019t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn\u2019t process it) is very unfair.\n\n\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.\n\n\nI hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.\n\n\nThanks and Regards"}, "3009": {"post_id": 612523, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/73", "original_text": "I haven\u2019t received any mails regarding the tds project 1 please look into my concern\n\n\n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n \n@s.anand"}, "3010": {"post_id": 612538, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/74", "original_text": "Sir please consider a re-evaluation for me, please :\u2019)"}, "3011": {"post_id": 612543, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/75", "original_text": "Please consider my situation a peer whos results were exactly same as mine has received 9, then how could I get 1 . 23f1002630 this is my role number please reconsider\n\n\n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj"}, "3012": {"post_id": 612544, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/76", "original_text": "Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1.

This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.\n\n\nAdding useful API endpoints, including an \n/api/\n multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing \n/read\n and \n/run\n endpoints from Project 1, plus a \n/clear\n endpoint to reset the agent\u2019s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.\n\n\nDeploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP\n, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI\u2019s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.\n\n\n\n\nAll this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent\u2014it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I\u2019m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like \nhyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents\n, and it would do that for you\u2014without \never\n declining the request. I like to think of it as a \nterminal version of\n \nOpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent\n.\n\n\n\n\nGiven all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it\u2019s incredibly discouraging to see my project \nnaturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)\n and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.\n\n\nTo clarify, \nall the updates mentioned above took place after March 29\n, \nafter Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.\n Furthermore, we were \nnever informed\n that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.\n\n\nMy only request is that if my \nupdated P1 submission cannot be evaluated\n due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my \noriginal P1 eval score could be reinstated\n instead of receiving a \n0\n\u2014since it was already evaluated and graded.\n\n\nWould highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard \n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj"}, "3135": {"post_id": 614391, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/207", "original_text": "pro 1\n720\u00d71600 81.5 KB\n\nActually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository.

It\u2019s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would\u2019ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\n\n\nRegarding your point on gold plating \u2014 I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory \u2014 to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible \nwithin the scope of the problem statement\n.\n\n\nWhat began as just another (pun intended) \ntedious\n assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. \n\n\n(\u2026caution: long post ahead \n)\n\n\nI noticed that \ntest cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use\n. While it would\u2019ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the \ninherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads\n. No two payloads are exactly alike \u2014 even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There\u2019s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.\n\n\nSome might suggest using \ntemperature=0\n to get more deterministic LLM behavior \u2014 and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn\u2019t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn\u2019t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There\u2019s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\n\n\nHardcoded tool agents also aren\u2019t really \u201cagents\u201d in my view\u2014 they\u2019re more like passive AI powered regex matchers\n: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to \u2018fix\u2019 them and keep calling them like a broken record.\n\n\nAt the core of it, it\u2019s all about \nhow much flexibility vs rigidity\n we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between \u2014 The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\n\n\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\n\n\n\n\nReason about the task, understand intent,\n\n\nReflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. \ndesign\n a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\n\n\nExecute those workflows (\nwalk\n the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\n\n\nObserve the final result, and repeat if needed.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, a similar framework was suggested in \nthis ICLR 2022 paper\n. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\n\n\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn\u2019t need dozens of narrow tools \u2014 just a small, well-defined set of \ngeneral-purpose tools\n:\n\n\n\n\nA REPL executor (for quick calcs)\n\n\nA Python script runner\n\n\nA Shell executor\n\n\n\n\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally \u2014 avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\n\n\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) \u2014 that was \nemergent behavior\n, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I\u2019ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. \nFrankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!\n\n\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & \n@s.anand\n for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. \nFood for thought! Really!\n\n\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I\u2019ll be experimenting with\u2014 modalities.\n\n\nPS: I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: \nthoughtful use of LLMs in agent design\n. At this point, I\u2019m less concerned about the marks, I\u2019m actually enjoying the thought joyride. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy approach doesn\u2019t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment.

This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\n\n\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\n\n\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\n\n\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\n\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\n\n\nRequest for Re-Evaluation\n\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\n\n\nPrevious Message for Reference\n\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\n\n\"Greetings, Sir,\n\n\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\n\n\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\n\n\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation?

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.\n\n\nWe are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.\n\n\nA minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.\n\n\nCritical failures prevents everything else from working\n and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified.

I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\n\n\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I\u2019m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn\u2019t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\n\n\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students\u2014including myself\u2014it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\n\n\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I\u2019ve worked hard to demonstrate.\n\n\nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I\u2019m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties\u2014especially for a single oversight\u2014can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities.

I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.\n\n\nHowever, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.\n\n\nAddressing the queries you raised in your post:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks.

For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.\n\nYou will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.\n\nYou have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the \u201cmail\u201d to get the bonus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.\n\n\u2026\n\n\nGiven this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.\n\n\nPlease note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy.

I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and \nmy peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.\n \nThey were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE\n release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.\n\n\nI understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn\u2019t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\n\n\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\n\n\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.\n\n\nFinally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\n\n\nI\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them.

Here is the main query that most people are having:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23f2004636:\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:\n\n\nEvery term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It\u2019s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.\n\n\nThe course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.\n\n\n192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone \u201cgets the opportunity to get bonus marks?\u201d Think about this\n\n\nAs a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that\u2019s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).\n\n\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?\n\n\nIt is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort \nbefore\n there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.\n\n\nOnce again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.\n\n\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it\u2019s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it\u2019s not a freebie.\n\n\nI had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA.

It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.\n\n\nThe main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.\n\n\nSir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they \nattended\n GA7.

Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.\n\n\nShouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don\u2019t misunderstand our request as jealousy \u2014 it comes from a place of hardship.\n\n\nHow can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.\n\n\nJust because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students\u2019 interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.\n\n\nRegards\n\nKarthik"}, "3523": {"post_id": 618988, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/47", "original_text": "@carlton\n \n@jkmadathil\n \n@s.anand\n sir,\n\nWe have sent a couple of messages regarding the fairness of bonus marks to the above discourse post but no satisfactory reply has been provided.

Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\n\n\nFirstly students \nvastly\n overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\n\n\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.\n\nOnly 2 students managed it.\n\n\nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 \nmight\n have even managed to get 3 or more marks.\n\n\nSo lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.\n The mean bonus score was 1.27.\n\n\nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\n\n\nThat is the data for you.\n\n\nStudent Bonus\n600\u00d7371 7.62 KB\n\n\nAlso noteworthy\n\n\nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.\n\n\nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, \u201cat least you should let us know before GA7\u201d. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?\n\n\nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are \nnot\n widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!\n\n\nBonuses are not a right.\n They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\n\n\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team.

This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets\u2014aside from myself\u2014may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.\n\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn\u2019t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.\n\n\nGiven these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted\n\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts."}, "3529": {"post_id": 619114, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/54", "original_text": "I am frankly surprised by this outcome.

I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\n\n\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n\n\n1000042547\n1080\u00d7578 187 KB\n\n\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter \u201cPOST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays\u201d\n\n\nTo filter such logs, we need:\n\n\nTime \u2192 for the hour and the day (Monday)\n\nMethod \u2192 to filter POST\n\nURL \u2192 to filter /images/\n\n\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\n\n\n\n\n Time, Method, URL\n\n\n\n\nTime \u2192 needed \n\nMethod \u2192 needed \n\nURL \u2192 needed \n\nReferer \u2192 not needed, but not harmful\n\n\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra \u2014 which doesn\u2019t invalidate it.\n\n\n1000042548\n1080\u00d7301 71.5 KB\n\n\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\n\n\nStatus is numeric (200)\n\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\n\n\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\n\n\nThe other options were as follows:\n\n\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n\n\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n\n\n9824 has no critical issue \u2014 it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n\n\n1000042545\n1079\u00d7468 35.7 KB\n\nCorrect Answer(s):\n\n\n PUT \u2013 Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\n\n\n GET \u2013 Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\n\n\n DELETE \u2013 Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\n\n\n\n\nIncorrect Answer:\n\n\n POST \u2013 Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n\n\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\n\n\nThank you"}, "3555": {"post_id": 619868, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/2", "original_text": "Agree & second all thoughts shared by \n@24f2003130\n above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also wanted to clarify on this question on filtered entries.

I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedundancy in Option A:\n\nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., \u201cPOST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1\u201d). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplicity in Filtering:\n\nFiltering for \u201cPOST requests under /images/\u201d from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime \u2192 for checking the hour and weekday.\n\n\nMethod \u2192 to filter only POST.\n\n\nURL \u2192 to ensure the request is under /images/.\n\n\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn\u2019t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency with Log Parsing Practices:\n\nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python\u2019s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice."}, "3559": {"post_id": 620467, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/queries-regarding-end-term-exam-solutions/172707/6", "original_text": "Sir, regarding point 3, score-checker tells a different story.
